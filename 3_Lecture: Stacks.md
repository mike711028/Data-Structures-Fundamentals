# Lecture: Stacks
## Definition
**Stack:**

Abtract data type with the following operations:
   + Push(key): adds key to collection
   + key Top(): returns most recently-added key
   + key Pop(): removes and returns most recently-added key
   + Boolean Empty(): are there any elements?
   
## Summary
   + Stacks can be implemented with either an array or a linked list
   + Each stack operation is O(1): Push, Pop, Top, Empty
   + Stacks are occasionally known as LIFO(last in first out) queues.
