# Reading: Welcome
Welcome to Data Structures!

In this course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. 
You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will
practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is 
going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it.
You will also learn typical use cases for these data structures.

Programming Assignments are a very important part of this course. We believe that the only way to
understand a data structure is to implement it. If you're studying this course as a part of Algorithms
and Data Structures MicroMasters program, you're already familiar with the style of the programming
assignments from the first course of the program - Algorithmic Design and Techniques. However, 
if you're taking this class independently, we strongly recommend that before you start working
on the Programming Assignments in this course, you first go through the videos and readings of
the first week of the Algorithmic Design and Techniques course: they will guide you through the
process of implementing a solution, testing it, finding bugs, fixing them and submitting the 
assignment. You will learn a very powerful testing technique that will lead you to success at
least 95% of the time. Also you will get general advice about working on Programming Assignments.

A few examples of questions that we are going to cover in this class are the following:

   1. What is a good strategy of resizing a dynamic array?
   2. How priority queues are implemented in C++, Java, and Python?
   3. How to implement a hash table so that the amortized running time of all operations is O(1) on average?
   4. What are good strategies to keep a binary tree balanced?
   
You will also learn how services like Dropbox manage to upload some large files instantly and to save 
a lot of storage space!

We look forward to seeing you in this class! We know it will make you a better programmer.
